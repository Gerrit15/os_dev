Bootloader

Bootloaders are in assembly, and set up the computer with magic bits and bytes for the kernal
A bootloader is the first 512 bytes of a hard drive, which presents a unique task
We'll be writing x86 asm

example instruction:
mov ax, 10

it moves 10 into register ax

registers ax ab cx and dx are 16 bit, divided into two 8bit parts, h and l
for example ax has ah and al

alongide being 512 bits, it also is terminated with the bits 55, aa

so a basic boot sector is 
  e9 fd ff 00 00 00 * 00 00 55 aa
e9 fd ff is an endless loop, and we already know what 55 aa does

That being said, if you want to define 55, aa as a "word" of bytes
you'd want to define it as 0xaa55 due to endingness, where this is little-endian
