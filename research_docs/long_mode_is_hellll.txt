Long mode is 64 bit mode, it's what you need to clamber into to load Rust (or C)

Long mode paging is a 4 table depth
an entry is 52-bit physical memory, with additional bits that be OR-ed in:

0 - present, it's currently in memory
1 - writable, it's allowed to write to this page
2 - user accessible, if not set, only the kernal can use this page
3 - write through caching
4 - disable cache
5 - accessed, cpu set bit for when the page is in use
6 - dirty, cpu set bit for when a write occurs
7 - huge page/null, must be nnull in p1 and p4, creates 1gib for p3, creates a 2mib in p2
8 - global, page isn't flushed from cache on address space switch
9-11 - available for os
52-62 - availabe for os
63 - no execute, forbit code from executing on this page


Long mode also has GDT, here's the bits:
0-41 - ignored
42 - conforming, current privialge level can be higher than the specified level for code segments
43 - executable, if set it's code, otherwise it's data
44 - descriptor type, should be 1 for data and code
45-46 - privialge, ring level, 0 for kernal, 3 for user
47 - present, must be 1 for valid selectors
48-52 - ignored in long mode
53 - 64bit, should be set
54 - 32bit, should not be set
55-63 - ignored
