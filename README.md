# A very basic operating system
This is my senior capstone, I will be researching how a basic operating system works. 
Because it is my capstone, I will be writing it in my preferred language, Rust. That being said, most traditional operating systems are built for C or in *fancier cases* C++

## Outline
- [ ] Understand the purpose of an operating system.
    - [ ] What is BIOS
    - [ ] What is system management
    - [ ] What is paging
    - [ ] Users vs Hardware
- [ ] Create a minimum Viable OS 
    - [ ] Create a BIOS based bootloader
    - [ ] Impliment text mode
    - [ ] Impliment Paging
- [ ] Stretch goals
    - [ ] User interaction
    - [ ] File system reader
    - [ ] User executable programs, similar to `cat` and `ls`
